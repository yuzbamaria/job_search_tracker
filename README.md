# Job Search Tracker App 

## Description
The app organizes your job search by allowing you to note key details like job title, company name, and location (city). 

The app provides a map view of company locations and keeps you motivated with inspirational quotes, lets you filter job cards by type (remote, hybrid, office) and stage (applied, interview, rejected).

**Main features:**
- Provides inspirational quotes when user adds key information about opportunities.
- Visualizes all your opportunities on a map at the same time to see the general picture.
- Filters job cards by type (remote, hybrid, office) and stage (applied, interview, rejected).

**Motivation:**
As we approach the completion of the bootcamp and prepare to embark on our job search, as a team we found this idea particularly resonant and meaningful on a personal level.

**User story:**
AS the job seeker 

I WANT to be able to log in the key data of each job posting I apply to 

SO THAT to filter this data later and see how the progress goes and if I need to change my approach based on this statistics from the app.
